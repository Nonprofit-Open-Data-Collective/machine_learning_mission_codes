# The Challenge of Big Data: Information Blindness 

## Topic Overview

  In this module’s reading the three authors pose challenges to the idea of “big data” and its actual usefulness to those that intend to use it. Patrick Meier defines big data as high volume, velocity and variety (Page 28). He uses the idea of social media to make this point. Overall, the theme between these three readings are how people are blind to the data they are collecting, its usefulness and how the user is analyzing the data they are receiving.

  Let’s take measuring impact for example. Non-profit and government agencies are always trying to demonstrate how they are measuring impact and what their contribution to society is. For business, this story is a little less complicated as they are primarily focused on profitability. However, in social organizations the overarching vision is a little more complex than measuring profitability. A common theme throughout the readings discuss clarity in purpose and focus on the outcome. Are we truly measuring what it is we (the organization) cares about? Are we actually collecting the data in which we need to in order to be able to measure what we care about? Or an even larger philosophical question posed by Gugerty and Karlan, do we (the organization) actually even know what we care about. 

  In our ever-increasing technological world, we are bombarded with immense amount of information. All of the texts outline human’s ability to process large amounts of information. But they also demonstrate the short comings of humans being able to analyze data or how we react to it if it is not digestible in a way to be useful or meaningful. Duhig calls this the shoving everything in the drawer response. 

  For us, the biggest over-arching theme to these readings is data’s connection to the work an organization is actually doing and how it can be utilized to amplify work. You can’t just be ok with massive data collection and not using it. Then it is just a waste of resources. Or if you are attempting to use it and using it in a way where people are blind to it or overwhelmed by it, then it becomes an even further waste of resources. You have to be clear about what it is you are striving for and what it is you want to collect. You cannot collect data and analyze before you are clear about why you are collecting and what it is you want to do with it. 
	
   Duhig makes excellent points with regards to the education parallels he draws. Government policies have been pushing big data collection on students and student achievement for the past 20 years. The reality is that policymaker’s hearts were in the right place, but local schools were ill-equipped to process this data. Teachers would become overwhelmed to this data and weren’t using it in a way that could be useful to their students. Teachers first needed to understand what they were assessing and why they were assessing it. Then they needed to understand how far into the data they were going. If a teacher gives a comprehensive assignment on many topics from an English unit and they only look at the overall grades on tests; they are not going to know what they need to do in order to better prepare different groups of students on their individual needs. The data sets of which they were already collected were too blunt. They needed to understand how students performed on various questions. The data needed to be disaggregated in a better format. Further, there needed to be an investment of time and training in order to better support teachers in utilizing this data.  In addition to receiving information and data, teachers were forced to engage with it.  They did their own analyses, tested hypothesis, tracked tests and measurements.  By engaging directly with the data they were better able to use it to improve student performance.     
	
  One of the biggest best practices from these readings comes from Gugerty and Karlan. The reflection questions they pose about theory of change and how to proceed on measuring outcomes is extremely informative. For example, they write: 

  “Validating the initial steps in the theory of change is a critical step before moving on to measuring impact. Consider a program to deliver child development, health, and nutrition information to expectant mothers in order to improve prenatal care and early childhood outcomes. Starting an impact evaluation before knowing if expectant mothers will actually attend the training and adopt the practices makes little sense. First establish that there is a basic take-up of the program and that some immediate behaviors are being adopted. Before starting an impact evaluation of a program providing savings accounts, determine whether people will actually open a savings account when offered, and that they subsequently put money into the account. If not, the savings account design should be reconsidered.”

## Chapter Summaries

**Digital Humanitarians by Patrick Meier (Pages 25-31)** 
This section of reading basically looks at the impact of social media as big data and its applicable uses to disaster relief. They talk about the immense amount of social media postings and content and how to parse through it. Not all of the posts are going to be relevant or timely. However, they do discus an opportunity with using this type of massive data availability in response to humanitarian efforts. It all about identifying what you are looking for. 

**Smarter Faster Better by Charles Duhig ( Chapter 8)** 
This chapter gives a variety of practical real-life examples of how people absorb data. From examples in the school system, which were discussed in the topic overview, to examples about people being able to choose retirement accounts. He uses all of these examples to show that people need to be able to absorb and digest data in an effective way in order to process it and make a decision. He calls the human ability to make these choices and breakdown data as scaffolding and winnowing. When people are able to process data effectively it has huge implications for the impact that it is able to have on business operations and even the lives of students. 

**Ten Reasons Not to Measure Impact – and What to Do Instead by Mary Kay Gugerty and Dean Karlan** 
This article focuses on organizations innate want to measure their impact and sometimes being blinded by what they are collecting. Governments and funders are increasingly calling on these organizations to demonstrate what it is they are doing and how those dollars are being used. They layout some of the missteps that current organizations fall into and what to do alternatively. For example, they discuss clarifying a theory of change, deciding on what programs to actually evaluate over others and how to effectively integrate data collection into current workstreams.

### Discussion Questions

1.	How are you blinded by data in your current organization? Do you feel overwhelmed by any data that you receive? What do you do when you receive this data?  

2.	Do you feel like you or your organization collect any data that is not used for anything? What is the data point? Do you know why it started being collected? 

3.	Do you feel that your current data procedures in your organization take away time from your work? Do you find data to be informative or not in your current practice? Why? 

4.	Disaster affected communities are increasingly becoming “digital communities” that turn to social media to communicate during disasters and to self-organize in response to crises.  Do you have your own examples of “digital communities” related to your organization and how does your organization work with them?
