With Markdown, it is possible to emphasize words by making them *italicized*, using *astericks* or _underscores_, or making them **bold**, using **double astericks** or __double underscores__. Of course, you can combine those two formats, with both _**bold and italicized**_ text, using any combination of the above syntax. You can also add a strikethrough to text using a ~~double tilde~~.

You can create [inline links](https://github.com) by wrapping link text in square brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). For example you can link your [home page](/).


If you have `show_excerpts` enabled, then this is the first paragraph that is only visible within the article and not in the preview. This is because `excerpt_separator` is set to two newlines which you can see above in the editor.
