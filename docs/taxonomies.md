title: "Taxonomies"
---

A variety of nonprofit activity codes have been created to describe missions and program activities. We have included two of the most common taxonomies, and some references for others. 

Machine learning techniques are also promising because they allow you to build your own taxonomies. You can then hand-code a small sample of the data, which is used as a training dataset to calibrate your machine learning algorithms ([for example](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-image-recognition-ai-with-5-lines-of-code-8ed0bdd8d9ba)), which can then code a large corpus of mission statements. We encourage you to think about creating your own purpose codes and sharing your approach. 


## NTEE Codes 

[NCCS Overview](https://nccs.urban.org/project/irs-activity-codes)

**Major Groups:**

* I. Arts, Culture, and Humanities - A
* II. Education - B
* III. Environment and Animals - C, D
* IV. Health - E, F, G, H
* V. Human Services - I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
* VI. International, Foreign Affairs - Q
* VII. Public, Societal Benefit - R, S, T, U, V, W
* VIII. Religion Related - X
* IX. Mutual/Membership Benefit - Y
* X. Unknown, Unclassified - Z

**Common Codes:** 

Common codes represent activities of organizations, such as research, fundraising, and technical assistance, which are common to all major groups. The seven common codes used are:

* 01 Alliance/Advocacy Organizations  
* 02 Management and Technical Assistance  
* 03 Professional Societies/Associations  
* 05 Research Institutes and/or Public Policy Analysis

## IRS 1023-EZ Purpose Codes

When applying for tax exempt status from the IRS, nonprofit founders report organizational purpose codes on the 1023 form. These codes differ from the NTEE taxonomies in that each code is binary (yes/no), and they are NOT mutually exclusive, so a nonprofit mission can fulfill one or several of these purposes. 

The IRS has started releasing some of the meta-data for 1023-EZ forms. Instructions for completing IRS 1023-EZ mission codes pp 6-7 [FORM](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1023ez.pdf)

* Religious Purpose [yes/no]
* Educational Purpose [yes/no]
* Scientific Purpose [yes/no]
* Literary Purpose [yes/no]
* Public Safety Purpose [yes/no]
* Ameteur Sports Purpose [yes/no]
* Prevent Cruelty to Animals and/or Children [yes/no]
